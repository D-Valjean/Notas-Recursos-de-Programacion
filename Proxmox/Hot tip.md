If the Proxmox server is connected to the internet (because of system updates, it usually is), the more efficient way of getting ISOs onto the local storage is to paste the URL in to a form and download direct from the internet into the ISO folder. How to do? [8:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZcOlW-DwrU&t=537s) - Copy the URL from ISO-file by right click on "download now"-link and select "copy link address" from the context menu, [9:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZcOlW-DwrU&t=579s) - select "Download from URL" from the ISO images category, paste the URL you've copied before into the URL form and click on query, the system will create a file name, press download. The system will download the ISO file direct onto Proxmox without download to another computer and reuploading again. Very nice feature, I wish Unraid will it become one day too.
