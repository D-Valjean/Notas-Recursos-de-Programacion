Also, why can't I share a folder with someone else?

The best way to download a folder would probably be to zip it up and download it via the 'Files' tab.

You can zip a folder in a Bash console using:

`zip -r myzipfile my_folder_name`

Alternatively, you can use something like bitbucket or github, and get version control as a bonus. There's some more info here: [https://www.pythonanywhere.com/wiki/FTP](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/wiki/FTP)

re: folder sharing with other users, that's something we hope to do one day. I'll add an upvote on your behalf...

I'm always googling for this haha and I will paste the following command if you want to unzip something you uploaded (using a Bash console, of course)

`unzip myzipfile.zip`
